			<h2>Testimony !</h2>

<h4>The purpose of this article</h4>
<p style="padding-top: 0px;">
	 We have written this testimony because we believe God can do this same miracle and greater for any young couple out there who are struggling financially. Please keep onto The Lord. Obey His word and He shall surely prosper you. 

</p> 
	<h4>A leap of faith !</h4><p style="padding-top: 0px;">
	Alfred and I have been dating for 7 sweet months now. I remember the very first time i said yes to him, it was a surprise to both of us. Surely God played such a great role in pushing each of us from our comfort single zones and undesiciveness into making the second most important committment for us after salvation. We were in love, and we both wanted nothing less from it other than marriage! The details of how this happened are for another day.

	<br>
	......</p>
	<h4>But we have no money</h4>
<p style="padding-top: 0px;">
	I remember the first hinderances we had at first that made us reluctant to say yes was money. Both of us had no steady income flowing in by then, although we both worked very had. I was frying and selling chapatis daily at my mum's while he was developing software for a company he had founded with a friend. They had not had any clients for 2 full years since the software wasn't even ready for sale yet. This meant that we couldn't meet as often as we wanted. He also told me consistently how unhappy he was because he couldn't buy me the nice things he desired so much to buy me. He was also worried about where my brideprice would come from.</p>
<h4>Light in darkness</h4>
<p style="padding-top: 0px;">
	Amidst this worry, we encouraged eachother in The Lord our God and we prayed so often together while we kept at our work.<br>We had confidence in the fact that our spiritual father (bishop Isaiah Mbuga), our marriage pastors (Ps. Henry Kibirige and Ps. Hadoto) and our mentors were praying for us.<br> As we prayed, I saw in a dream when Alfred had gotten so much money that he had fully funded all our premarital occassions, including our wedding preparations. He had also fully paid my brideprice, even plus a bonus. I must say, this dream encouraged me so much and I shared it with him as well......<br><br></p>
<h4>Tables turn finally</h4>
	<p style="padding-top: 0px;">
	8 months down the road, a mighty breakthrough finally happened. Alfred landed a juicy contract from his company website -><a href="https://ugfire.com"> ugfire.com </a>. This came at such a time when we needed it so much (our wedding was just 60 days away and the pressure was soon piling) . Surely, God makes all things beautiful in His time. Alfred was then able to cover all the expenses amd more than we needed for all our wedding preparations. We had such a lovely and sweet wedding that it will forever live in our memories.

<h4>More Success</h4>
<p style="padding-top: 0px;">
	After our wedding, we decided to pursue purpose together. Alfred was a Godly man and he knew that having found me (his wife), he had obtained favor from The Lord. We knew that God had greatly blessed us and we believed it.<br>
	<br>As I write this article today, just 7 months after our wedding, we have constructed our own beautiful mansion and we are moving in soon, Godwilling. We have also planned to build a home for orphans and needy children and we shall be executing phase one soon.<br>
	My husband is running one of the most vibrant educational studios in Africa. He has promoted my music so much and now  the studio records as many of my songs as I please. I oversee a music school in the same studio aiming at promoting young talent. Let me stop there for now :-)<br>  We have honestly forgotten what it feels like to beg and to lack, and we believe the journey has just begun.</p>
