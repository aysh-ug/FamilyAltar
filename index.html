	Every family member is a gift of God for your life – your spouse and children. Yes, they may not turn out exactly as you wished or expected, yet God has brought you together for a divine purpose. (Proverbs 5:15).
What this scripture is saying is that you should cherish what you have. A man's source of affection should be his own wife. For the woman too, her source of affection should be her husband. Neither husband nor wife should seek sexual satisfaction outside the home. They are special gifts to each other, from God; which should be cherished with pleasure, purity and thanksgiving.
Take full advantage of what God has blessed you with as a family man or woman. There are many blessings that God has deposited in your family for your benefit. Apart from your husband or wife, God has also blessed you with children. Has He not also blessed you with material, financial and intellectual resources? 
Use all of them to your maximum benefit and for unlimited progress in this life. Proverbs 5:21 says, “For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and He pondereth all his goings.” God is watching how you are handling all these resources placed at your disposal. God is assessing and measuring your performance.
God is watching whether you are using them wisely and judiciously. God knows when you become careless with these valuable resources to the disadvantage of the health and wellbeing of your family. Proverbs 15:3 says, “The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.” The believer who wants to prosper in the Lord will be mindful of how he or she handles family affairs and God-given resources at his or her disposal. 
Family resources are the commonwealth of the family and should be used for the good of all in the family. The care and love of your family should be paramount in your mind to avoid opening the door for Satan. After God, it is your family.<br> May the Lord keep you together and prosper you all as you do this in Jesus name.<br><br>
Thought for the day:  After God, our family should come next.
