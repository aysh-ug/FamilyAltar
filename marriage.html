<h4>The lie</h4>
<p style="padding-top: 0px;">
	 Many times the challenges of marriage are exaggerated to mean that they are just too much. Is it the truth? May be, maybe not. Well today I would like to say something about it. 

</p> 
	<h4>The reality</h4><p style="padding-top: 0px;">
	Generally the human satisfaction is crafted around successfully overcoming challenges. That is why we celebrate every success that comes our way because they don’t come easy. Imagine after finishing school, attaining the highest position in your company and in business and then what? I believe your life would literally stop because there would be nothing else to look for.  Well, there comes marriage with no arrival point because well there are no positions to attain in and there is no end to the challenges until one or both of you dies. I believe it is the reason why it appears to be different from the challenges we face at the work place, at school, in business and everywhere.
	<br>
	......</p>
	
<p style="padding-top: 0px;">
	But are we putting the same energy we put in our works to impress our bosses in order to score highly in our end of year evaluation into our marriages? To a greater extent, I think we are not, we are simply giving our marriages the left overs of ourselves. When our bosses scream at us in office, we get angry but we rarely quit. We pick ourselves up and show up for work the following day. But when a misunderstanding happens with our spouse and the same happens we could actually pack or decide to sleep in a bar. Yet a job is merely an aid to marriage. Marriage is work just like our jobs, may be our jobs are easier because they come with job descriptions but our spouses come without user manuals meaning that we even have more work to do in marriage than at our work places. Someone once said, if want the rose flower you should be willing to be pricked by the thorns meaning that you cannot pick one side and leave the one that is undesirable. A spouse comes as a complete package with the bad and good side. Enjoy the good side while adapting you to live with the bad side partly this is an assessment of what you do in courtship.<br>... </p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">
	Working on the challenges of marriage and succeeding at them is where the satisfaction lies. Many people say marriage is not an achievement true just like joining primary school is not an achievement but passing PLE is meaning also transcending the challenges of marriage in it-self is the achievement.
<br>...</p>

	<p style="padding-top: 0px;">
	If there was nothing good to be found in marriage, why would then people continuously join the marriage institution day and night? Are you sure they are not hearing our bitterness about marriage? Well they do but because we have not provided a better alternative to replace marriage, the craving for marriage is much bigger than the negative things that are said about it. I have seen some people who were once very vocal about how bad men are, how they don’t need a man to live their life eventually forcing a marriage even if it meant betraying a friend to just get themselves a man. What does this mean, instead of demonizing this marriage institution, let us work hard and bring sanity to it so that our daughters and sons can get it on the right footing.</p>
